# Summarize the project and the problem it was solving
The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

# What did you do particularly well?
I really liked how I did the menu. and the code that allowed the user to print off their data. I feel like that of everything, that part was structured well.

# Where could you enhance your code?
Comments. Explaining what I am doing is always a challenge. Comments would make my code more readable, as far as someone else looking over my work. 

#Which peaces of code did you find the most challenging to write?
Printing the data in a histogram. For some reason, I could not understand how I was supposed to do it. It took several youtube videos for it to click. I found that watching someone work through similar problems helped me to understand what I was doing!

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think being able to have a file read and print data onto another file will be a useful tool for projects, especially more coding and running code. Finding simple guides on youtube will also help with coursework, as listening to someone explain what I need to do will help me a lot.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable?
I sectioned off everything, so nothing is one big long piece of code. There are line breaks when I moved on to a different funtion within the code, like with the menu.
